15/10/19 - Started the project on my laptop, Android Studio is being a bitch and everytime I try and use the visual editor it crashes Android Studio.
I am just editing the XML directly to get around this crashing because it's pissing me off and I need to start the project.
Working on the start page at the moment. Working on the positioning of the buttons but may leave the positioning until the end.
16/10/19 (Morning) - Stuck on where to start now I have my environment set up. Created a small list of TODOs to complete.
Real basic shit like "Create information page about yourself" with the hopes that if I just start doing something it's better than nothing.
I created a modules class, basically copied the headfirst android cookbooks workout class and changed it a bit. 
16/10/19 (Afternoon) - Started by creating an Information page for the project. Put the functionality to get to the 
information page by clicking the information button on the home screen. I also ran the app on my phone and made sure USB 
Debugging worked. I'm still getting used to Android Studio on Linux but I'm getting more confident.
31/10/19 - Happy Halloween ME! Well spent working on the project. You created the listFragment for the modules activity and
created an intent that then passed to that page. The listFragment worked really well and displayed everything it was supposed
to. I am calling it quits here. I can make the buttons do things later. 
01/11/19 - I spent four hours doing stuff and achieving fuck all. Added a listener to listen for button clicks and an interface
to communicate between the modulesPage activity and the modulesList fragment so when a listItem is selected it feeds back
the item ID to the activity which then launches the next activity, the submodulesPage, and passes the module ID to it.
This however doesn't seem to be working and keeps on crashing the app.
02/11/19 - Figured out the error from yesterday. I was trying to override a method from the superclass ... (finish later
I need to go to work.) The method was onListItemClick and I was trying to override included a long of ID. I had tried to make that 
an int, which obviously didn't work because it's calling a superclass method, so I was getting the error of no method in the
superclass. I fixed that and now the app doesn't crash when I try to click on lists. 
03/01/20 - Looking back through the code and understanding what is happening in it. Also fixed the problem where the submodule ID was 
always identical causing the same submodules to be displayed no matter which module was selected. The cause of this issue was the 
difference between the fragment and activity lifecycle. In submodulesPage the intent lines of code extracting the module ID and 
storing it in a local variable were put after the setContentView(...) method. The setContentView(...) method gave control of the page
to the fragment, which would then take over, causing the intent code to never be ran. As Integers default to 0 in Java it meant the 
moduleID always appeared to be 0 and so the same submodules were displayed no matter what.
09/01/20 - Created displayQuestion activity, testQuestionGeneration, and question class. The displayQuestion activity aims to do exactly what 
it says on the tin, it is supposed to display questions, and will enable the user to input and check an answer. The testQuestionGeneration is 
a factory class which will contain methods which will return the question class. The question class will contain all of the information 
required for the displayQuestion activity to display a question and check an answer. 
This notes file was changed to display next steps at the top of the page, so I have an idea of what I want to complete in the next programming 
session. 
Also, added a text box to displayQuestion to test displaying a question. Then linked submodulesPage to it so that it can be tested. Messed around
with private variables so that I could see when they were destroyed as well. 
10/01/20 - Issue where trying to add an image into android studio would not work if the image contained an upper case letter. This means no 
image files can contain the camel case naming convention. This took about 20 minutes to figure out and fix. Also, a test image was displayed in 
the app to display what will occur when the test questions require a picture.
Attempted to put an image in a folder drawable-anydpi thinking it would be displayed in any situation, but it wouldn't display on my phone,
turns out I have to put it into a drawable-nodpi folder. Although, an image was displayed. 
Added a button which when clicked will display a different image, this can be used to submit a question and change to the next question. 
22/01/20 - Converted what I had before, which was basically displaying a dummy question, into actually displaying a very basic question.
Changed the text box to only accept integers and to display some shadow text when it has nothing in it. The question generates 5 random 
numbers and the student is instructed to select the smallest number. The button actually checks the answer.
Once the answer was checked I then worked on getting a new question generated, the same question just with 5 other randmom numbers. 
The only issue is when the button is pressed the old answer stays in the text box and has to be deleted so I'm gonna look into getting 
rid of the old answer in the text box. 
Successfully removed the old answer using one line of answerBox.getText().clear(); answerBox is the EditText object which was selected 
earlier and held the answer in. This is all in displayQuestion.java class. 
Added a question for each module depending on which module has been selected in the listView before. 
29/01/20 - Expanded the questions in the numbers module so that there are 5 of them which all appear randomly, so any could be selected.
These are all questions marked foundation in testQuestionGeneration.java to help with adding question difficulties. The idea of question 
difficulties changed though as instead of having three question difficulties, easy, medium, and hard, I will have foundation and higher. 
These are built into the GCSE Maths syllabus so I might as well use them.
Added methods for each question to display a random question for the module which has been selected. Even those which don't have questions
already, they have dummy questions in place. This works for all modules. Also, I organised the modules which already had questions to 
be organised around the submodules which they are a part of. This will hopefully make it easier when I add the submodules into the 
question selection process.
Added more questions for algebra and statistics. Had an issue with casting from a decimal to an int, with order of operations but 
by changing the order I fixed it.
Figured out how to display numbers to powers using this wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts
and this stackoverflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12208275/output-a-number-raised-to-a-power-as-a-string showing how to 
display powers using unicode.
