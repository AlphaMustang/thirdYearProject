15/10/19 - Started the project on my laptop, Android Studio is being a bitch and everytime I try and use the visual editor it crashes Android Studio.
I am just editing the XML directly to get around this crashing because it's pissing me off and I need to start the project.
Working on the start page at the moment. Working on the positioning of the buttons but may leave the positioning until the end.
16/10/19 (Morning) - Stuck on where to start now I have my environment set up. Created a small list of TODOs to complete.
Real basic shit like "Create information page about yourself" with the hopes that if I just start doing something it's better than nothing.
I created a modules class, basically copied the headfirst android cookbooks workout class and changed it a bit.
